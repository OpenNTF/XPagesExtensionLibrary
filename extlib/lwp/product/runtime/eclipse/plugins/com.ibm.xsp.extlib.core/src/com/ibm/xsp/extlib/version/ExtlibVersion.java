/**
 * The Extension Library tag version, used with {@link XspLibrary#getTagVersion()} 
 * and {@link FacesDefinition#getSince()}.
 * 
 * From 9.0 the versions are in the form:
 *   "a.a.a.vbb_dd"
 * like 
 *   "9.0.1.v00_03"
 * where
 * "a.a.a" is the Notes/Domino version (like 9.0.0)
 * "v" is the letter "v"
 * "bb" is the Domino upgrade pack level
 *      e.g. Upgrade Pack 01 or Upgrade Pack 02. The level 00 is not an UpgradePack.
 * "dd" is the openNTF release number, which is generally incremented with 
 *      every openNTF release, where 01 is the first openNTF release, 
 *      and 00 is not an openNTF release.
 * 
 * The early releases, before 9.0, the versions were in the form:
 *   "a.a.abcdd"
 * like 
 *   "8.5.32005"
 * where
 * "a.a.a" is the Notes/Domino version (like 8.5.3)
 * "b" is the Domino upgrade pack level / stream in active development 
 *      e.g. Upgrade Pack 1 or Upgrade Pack 2, or 0 - no upgradePack.
 * "c" is usually 0, reserved for fix pack levels (FixPack1 or FixPack2)
 * "dd" is the release number on openNTF - which may be incremented 
 *      with every openNTF release or upgrade pack release (or may not, if no tags are added)
 * 
 * 
 * null is the 8.5.3 Upgrade Pack 1 release, or any openNTF release prior 
 *      to the introduction of versioning.
