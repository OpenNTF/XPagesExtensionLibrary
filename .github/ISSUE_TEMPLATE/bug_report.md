Remember, an issue is not the place to ask questions. StackOverflow should be used for questions. We have a Slack channel on OpenNTF Slack workspace for discussions.

Before you open an issue, please check if a similar issue already exists or has been closed.

### Please include the following:
- [ ] Domino server version
- [ ] Extension Library version
- [ ] Steps to reproduce
- [ ] Expected behaviour
- [ ] Actual behaviour

###IMPORTANT
We will take bug reports for issues with core issues. However, please check functionality also against the core Extension Library that comes with the relevant Domino version. If the issue can be reproduced there, raise a support ticket with IBM / HCL as well and reference that ticket here. This will help cross-reference when speaking to HCL for inclusion in the next release.
